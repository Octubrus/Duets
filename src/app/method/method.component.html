  <p class="lead">The Divertimento Duets concept breaks away from the traditional violin/piano accompaniment format, instead presenting a
    fun and effective way of learning the violin that involves complete interaction between teacher and pupil.</p>
  <p>These duets are intended for the teacher and pupil to play together without relying on a piano accompaniment to complete

    and listen to others from the very start. It is also the perfect tool for a teacher who does not have access to a piano.</p>
